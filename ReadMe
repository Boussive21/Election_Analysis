#Challenges
For me personally was making sure that the files loaded correctly and where correctly pathed to the multiple times while working on this I got Errors 2 that meant that the files where not present. Another thing to mention was putting : at the end of ifs to correctly end them. 
#Possible futures use
In the future Colorado could use this file for other elections one possible use case would simply changing the csv file every year in the file_to_load variable. The second use case changing the variables entirely into a new form but uses the same equations and modules.
